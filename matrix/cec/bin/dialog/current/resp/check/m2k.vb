    '' The phrase "Partial Overrides Property PathCurrent() As String" suggests
    '' a context where a property named `PathCurrent` is declared or implemented
    '' in a partial class and is being overridden in some way, returning a `String`. 

'' To clarify:

'' - A **partial class** in languages like C# allows the class definition to be split across
'' multiple files, but it is still one class when compiled. You cannot truly override a property
'' within partial class parts because partial is about splitting a single class, not inheritance.
'' - The keyword **Overrides** is used in languages like Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) to indicate
'' that a member overrides a base class member.
'' - The declaration implies a **property** called `PathCurrent` which returns a `String`.
'' - Typically, "Overrides Property PathCurrent() As String" would be used in VB.NET in a derived
'' class to override a base class's `PathCurrent` property.
'' - However, **partial and override together might hint at a situation where a partial class contains
'' an override of a base class property**.

'' Given this, the phrase is probably from a VB.NET code snippet in a derived partial class, where the
'' `PathCurrent` property is overridden to return a specific current path as a string.

'' I will now gather specific examples and definitions for partial classes and overriding properties
'' like `PathCurrent` in VB.NET or similar .NET languages for clarity.I will search for explanations
'' and examples specific to "Partial Overrides Property PathCurrent() As String" in VB.NET or similar
'' .NET languages to clarify usage and semantic.{"queries":["VB.NET partial overrides property PathCurrent
'' string example","VB.NET override property example PathCurrent"]}The declaration "Partial Overrides
'' Property PathCurrent() As String" is typical in VB.NET. It indicates that a property called
'' PathCurrent is overridden in a derived class, returning a String, and the class containing this
'' override is declared as Partial, meaning the class implementation is split across multiple files.

'' Key points:
'' - "Partial" means the class implementation spans multiple files.
'' - "Overrides" means this property overrides the base class's virtual or overridable property.
'' - "Property PathCurrent() As String" declares a property named PathCurrent that returns a String.
'' - The property can have a Get accessor and optionally a Set accessor.
'' - This syntax is common in VB.NET, where you override inherited members, including properties, in a partial class.

'' Example in VB.NET:

'' ```vb
    Public interface IText
        Public Property StrList() As Args
    end interface

    Partial Class DerivedClass
        Inherits BaseClass
        Implements IText
    End Class
'' ```

'' This allows the defined class to override the PathCurrent property, possibly spreading
'' implementation across partial class files.

'' Thus, "Partial Overrides Property PathCurrent() As String" is a VB.NET declaration in a
'' partial class that overrides a string property PathCurrent inherited from a base class.
'' It is used to provide custom get/set behavior for this property in the partial class
'' implementation.
