Here are some recommended automated tools and CI steps to update changelog entries efficiently:

1. **Changeish (AI-powered changelog automation)**
    - A Bash script that parses git commit history and uses a local AI model (like Ollama) to generate consistent, summarized changelog entries.
    - Can be integrated into CI pipelines to automate changelog updates with human-like summaries.
    - Fully local operation ensures privacy and control over data.

2. **GitLab CI Changelog Automation**
    - Using GitLab CI pipelines and their Changelog API, you can automate changelog generation by extracting commit messages and creating/updating `CHANGELOG.md`.
    - Example step: Run a script pipeline job that uses GitLab API to post changelog updates after version tags are created.

3. **conventional-changelog-cli**
    - CLI tool that generates changelogs from git commit messages following conventional commit standards.
    - Can be triggered as part of CI/CD or on version bump commands.

4. **logchange**
    - A tool aimed at maintaining consistent changelog formats and solving conflicts by separating changelog entries during merge requests.

5. **versionize**
    - Automates versioning and changelog generation based on commit messages using custom patterns for breaking changes and features.

### Typical CI Workflow Example
- After commits are merged or a release branch is created:
    - Run changelog generation tool/script.
    - Review or automatically commit updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
    - Proceed with build and release steps.

This automation reduces manual effort, ensures changelog consistency, and keeps release documentation up to date with minimal delay.

If needed, specific example CI YAML snippets or integration instructions can be provided for tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps. Would that be helpful?
