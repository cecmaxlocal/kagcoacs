"IDE Coke" does not appear to be a known or official IDE product with a specific license. However, if the question relates to licensing for the standard and leading IDE for Visual Basic and .NET C# development—Microsoft Visual Studio—here is a summary:

### Visual Studio Licensing Overview:
- **Visual Studio Community Edition:**  
  - Free for individual developers, students, open source projects, and small teams (up to 5 users).  
  - Provides a full-featured IDE with support for Visual Basic and C#.  
  - Licensed under its own Microsoft Community License Agreement.

- **Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise Editions:**  
  - Paid subscriptions with additional enterprise features, support, and services.  
  - Licensed per user, either via monthly or annual subscriptions or perpetual licenses depending on purchase.  
  - Requires purchase through Microsoft Store, volume licensing, or resellers.  

- **Licensing Terms:**  
  - Licenses are generally per user, allowing installation on multiple devices for the licensed user.  
  - Visual Studio subscriptions include software, Azure DevOps access, and additional tools depending on the level (Professional or Enterprise).

For a mixed Visual Basic and C# project, Visual Studio Community is usually sufficient unless advanced enterprise features or team scale require Professional or Enterprise.

### Summary:
- If "IDE Coke" is a reference to Visual Studio or a derivative IDE, it would fall under Visual Studio's licensing terms.  
- Check [Visual Studio Licensing Whitepaper](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Visual-Studio-Licensing-Whitepaper-July2023.pdf) for detailed license info.  
- For open-source or small team projects, Visual Studio Community Edition is free and powerful enough.

If further clarification or specific license documents for a particular tool named "IDE Coke" are needed, additional details would be required. Otherwise, using Visual Studio 2022 under Microsoft’s licensing is standard for Visual Basic and .NET C# desktop development.[1][3]
