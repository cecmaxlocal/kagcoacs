Dell machines typically come with OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) licenses for software like Windows pre-installed. Here are key points about licensing on Dell machines:

- **OEM Licenses:** The software license (e.g., Windows) that comes pre-installed on Dell PCs is usually an OEM license tied to that specific machine. It is non-transferable to other machines and typically valid only for the original hardware.

- **Licensing Restrictions:**  
  - If you reinstall the OS on the same Dell machine, the OEM license allows activation without needing additional license keys.  
  - If you try to install the OEM software on a different machine, the license is invalid and will require a retail license key.  
  - Significant hardware changes, like motherboard replacement, might require a new license.

- **Support:** OEM licenses, including those on Dell machines, require the licensee (owner/user) to provide technical support for the software unless a separate support contract with Microsoft is purchased.

- **License Management:** Dell offers tools such as Dell License Manager and Dell Digital Locker for managing software licenses and downloads associated with your Dell hardware.

- **Software Delivery:** Some Dell software may come bundled with licenses, including system utilities and bundled applications, subject to their own EULAs.
