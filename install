To install an IDE setup like "IDE Coke" for Visual Basic and .NET C# desktop development, the recommended and standard approach is to install Visual Studio 2022, which fully supports both languages and rich .NET desktop app development.

### Steps to Install Visual Studio 2022 (Recommended IDE):

1. **Download the Installer**
   - Go to the official Microsoft Visual Studio website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
   - Choose the edition you want (Community is free for most users).
   - Download the Visual Studio Installer executable.

2. **Run the Installer**
   - Open the downloaded installer file.
   - Accept the User Account Control prompt if it appears.

3. **Select Workloads**
   - In the installer, select workloads like:
     - **.NET desktop development** (for Visual Basic, C# Windows Forms, WPF)
     - Optionally other workloads relevant to your environment (ASP.NET if building web parts, etc.)

4. **Install and Launch**
   - Click `Install` and wait for the installation to complete.
   - Launch Visual Studio after installation.
   - Sign in with a Microsoft account (optional).

### Why Visual Studio?
- Full support for developing desktop applications with Visual Basic and C#.
- Excellent debugging, project management, and language tooling.
- Supports mixed-language projects via solution files (.sln).
- Enables integration with build pipelines and version control.

If "IDE Coke" refers to a custom or niche IDE, the process might differ, but Visual Studio is the industry-standard IDE for this tech stack.
